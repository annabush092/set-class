# set-class

This is a simple exercise to build out my own Set class using only primitive datatypes in Java.

There are two classes, the MySet class, which defines the Set Class, and the SetTests class, which defines tests for all MySet functionality and runs them in main().

To run in the console:
javac MySet.java
javac SetTests.java
java SetTests
=> will print test results in the console.


A note on my tests:
This is an exercise primarily to improve my understanding of the Java syntax and Set Class.
Because I am new to Java, I have decided to implement my own test methods, instead of using a Java test package. I made this decision instead of opting for a package because I wanted also to improve my understanding of Object Orientation in Java, and this is a good opportunity to write two classes that interact with each other.

Thanks for checking out my code!
