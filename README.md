# set-class

This is a simple exercise to build out my own Set class using only primitive datatypes.

There are two classes, the MySet class, which defines the Set Class, and the SetTests class, which defines tests for all MySet functionality and runs them in main().

To run in the console:
javac MySet.java
javac SetTests.java
java SetTests
=> will print test results in the console.
